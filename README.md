# Haskell Challenge

Problem Statement:
You need to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:

- If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Beep" instead of that number.
- If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Boop" instead of that number.
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "BeepBoop" instead of that number.


Your solution must be written in the Haskell Programming Language. You have been provided with an incomplete solution.
Any "_" characters denote where you must fix the incomplete code. You may google haskell code documentation to figure out the solution.

Here is an online compiler where you can write and run Haskell code: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_haskell_online.php

Provide a screenshot of your completed code and the output to your meeting chat when finished!
